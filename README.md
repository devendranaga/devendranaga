## Hi there 👋

I code in C, C++, Python and Rust.
I mostly write networking and security software / firmware for embedded systems such as switches, routers, devices such.
I have expertise in writing modular, tiny, and performant firmware and software code for firewalls, and cryptography.
If you'd like to hire me, you can create a bug in any of my repos, that is the easiest way i can respond.
